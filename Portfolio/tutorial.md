<!-- This is an example of how I have written tutorials across various roles. For this document, I created a basic website after completing the "Complete Intro to Web Development, v3" on frontendmasters.com and documented my own process below as a tutorial. I assume no prior knowledge from the user and explain any new or complex concepts fully. -->
