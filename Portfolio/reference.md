This document is an example of how I have written reference guides, such as manuals for devices used by engineers. This example is simplified, as real manuals of this type are typically 20-30 pages

# RT3000 Reference Guide

The **OT3000** is a multi-function RTU designed for oil wellheads. It is capable of fully autonomous operation for 4000 hours before requiring maintenance. It has an on-board memory of 200GB to store temperature, pressure, flow rate, and time data from the last 28 days. It uses a rechargeable lithium battery to continue operation in the event of a power loss, which will last for 48 hours. Please refer to the **Replacing RTU battery** manual when replacing the battery.

**Note:** The OT3000 is not used for LPG or water wellheads. Refer to the **LT1000** and **WT2000** RTUs respectively.

The OT3000 communicates with SCADA using wifi internet on a closed network. This network must be in place and configured **before** the device is installed. 

When installed for the first time, the RTU will automatically download program data from SCADA and begin operation after a few minutes.
