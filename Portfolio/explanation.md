This document is an example of a topic I wrote for my previous employer Evolutionizer. Their EVO-Cloud product uses a dashboard to host one or more modules that each perform a single specific function such as displaying a list, peforming financial calculations, and so on. By combining several modules on the dashboard, users can create large-scale and multi-faceted processes to achieve their goals. The aim of topics like this was to describe a module in isolation without referencing how to create or configure it, as that information was written in a dedicated configuration manual. The topic concludes with several examples of how the module would be configured and used within a dashboard to help give users the full context of its application. I have removed anything specific to Evolutionizer and kept the content generic.
