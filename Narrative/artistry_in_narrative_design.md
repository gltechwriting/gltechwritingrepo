<!-- I was inspired to write this essay after attending a talk by Susan O'Connor, a seasoned game writer and wise sage of the industry. She recommended that aspiring narrative designers demonstrate some insight into narrative design, so I have written this essay focussing on three computer games I feel have very strong and impactful narratives -->

# The Artistry of Narrative Design

I was given my first games console when I was 16. I had successfully passed my GCSEs and my father bought an N64 as a reward. Until that point in my young and sheltered life I had understood 'art' to be books, paintings, films, television shows and so on, and had considered computer games to be little more than arcade-style entertainment. Suffice it to say, my worldview would be changed and the debate of 'can video games be art?' would be forever settled as a resounding 'yes'.

I'm going to discuss three computer games from across the ages that I feel are good examples of art in narrative design. What do I mean by art in narrative design? I don't believe there is one answer, but my answer is simply this: does the story and the game mechanics by which that story is relayed make you *feel* something? I don't mean joy at beating a boss or the satisfaction of a high score, I mean grief at a character's death, fear at turning that next corner, or vividly imagining yourself in your hero's plight. While a book or film might also make us feel those things, only a computer game puts those decisions or dilemnas at your command - *you* have to open that door, *you* have choose which character survives the finale.

I'm intentionally including the *mechanism* of the story in my definition. There are many different genres of game and may different methods by which a player plays. But I feel that those methods, in and of themselves, can elevate and enrich a story far beyond words or graphics ever could. Indeed, the very act of *playing* the game involves you in the art in a way no other art can

The three games I want to discuss are:

- Halo: Combat Evolved, Xbox
- Homeworld, PC
- The 'Horizon' series of games, Playstation

Three very different games from three very different eras. *All* have stayed with me to this day, *all* have made me feel something no other medium has. I've intentionally left out RPG games. I'm a huge fan of RPG games, but I feel that they are so heavily narrative-driven by design that they would make my point for me. If I described how each of the different origins in Dragon Age: Origins completely changed my perspective of the story as a whole, I think I'd only be describing how the game itself is intended to work. *Of course* my dwarf rogue has a different emotional investment in the story to my human noble. I'm not criticising that game, I'm simply more interested in discussing the narrative of games that are presented as-is, and how each of us take from them something unique despite that fact.

## Halo: Combat Evolved

Like many teens at the time, I bought the brand-new Xbox console bundled with an unknown IP from an unknown studio. Halo: Combat Evolved (or simpy Halo) was a profound experience in my creative life.

To summarise the game: you play as a cyborg super-soldier referred to simply by his rank: the Master Chief. Your identity is never revealed, you hardly speak, and you are always shown in your armour. In the few moments where your helmet is removed, the camera is deliberately pointed elsewhere. You start the game onboard a spaceship crewed by archetypal sci-fi soldiers in the middle of a large battle. Who your aggressors are and their motivations are unclear, outside of your extermination. There is some clear familiarity with certain characters - Captain Keyes and the onboard AI Cortana - but we seem to be the only one of our kind. After a brief training routine we are thrust into the story and the combat.

The 'cipher' type main character was not a new idea with Halo but it was for me. Until then, my most beloved game was The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Despite having little characterisation of his own, Link and his adventure felt much more immersive and realised. By comparison, Master Chief could have been anybody with powered armour and a gun.

It became apparent to me that Master Chief doesn't really know what he's doing. We've landed on the Halo, but he doesn't know what it is or what it's for. He simply does what he's best at - shoot the things that shoot you. It is down to characters like Keyes and Cortana to push you forward and provide context, and they themselves figure things out as we go.

We start the game engaged in all-out war with the Covenant - an alien civilisation made up of several, distinct, species who all conveniently fights with given strenghts and weaknesses. About half way through the game you encounter a threat no one is familiar with - the Flood. Ostensibly a 'zombie' type enemy, they are relentless and mindless. They cannot be understood, only stopped. Or, more realistically, ran from.

At this same time you encounter an intelligent drone seemingly native to the Halo - 343 Guilty Spark. He (or 'it', but I will refer to it as he) describes himself as something of a custodian of the Halo and that he requires our help in dealing with the emergence of the Flood. So far, so normal. To the Master Chief, and the player, this is simply one new and unknown alien after another. So we go along with his plan. We wander vast and expansive levels attending to the various tasks required, running-and-gunning all the while.

Until we realise what 343 Guilty Spark's plan *actually* is. He seeks to activate the Halo, starting a chain reaction that will essentially wipe out all life in the entire galaxy. He explains that there is no way to stop the Flood. They can consume any foe and perpetuate themselves endlessly. Any species that tries to stop them will always lose by attrition. As such, the designers of the Halo saw only one solution - the extinction of all life and the starvation of the Flood. And we have 'followed containment procedure to the letter' this entire time. We were not deceived. 343 Guilt Spark was not malevolent or working to an ulterior motive. He is simply an AI with no comprehension of life or interest in the extinction of it. And he directed us to that end much like a technician restarting a server over the phone would.

That moment hit me like a proverbial truck. We had followed the run-and-gun, push-that-button, kill-those-enemies approach the whole time. And we had gone from clearing corridors of comical little idiots to pointing a gun at the head of the galaxy, all at the same pace using the same mechanics. Neither the cut scenes or gameplay had changed our role at all, only now we were more involved in the story than ever before - and more than anyone else.

Concurrent to these events, Captain Keyes is captured and turned into a Flood. A horrific and fatal process. On our way to the finale, we find him and have to kill him to end his suffering. I couldn't help but feel that we - the player, Master Chief - had somehow enabled this to happen. If we had understood what we were facing sooner, if we had understood 343 Guilty Spark's intentions, perhaps we might have acted differently. I felt a very personal motivation to rescue him and was very sad to have to kill him.

## Homeworld

## Horizon

I never expected a game to affect me as profoundly as the Horizon games did, and especially at this age.
